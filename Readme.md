# FirebaseUI-CRUD

Sample app demonstrates the Authentication and CRUD operations. It is based on features of [FirebaseUI](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android)
open-source library for Android. 

In order to pass authentication procedures 
follow [Add Firebase to Your Android Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup)
and [Enable Google Sign-In in the Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/google-signin) 
to generate **google-services.json** from [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and add it to the project.

Load the project in Android Studio and run it on your Android device/emulator to see.
